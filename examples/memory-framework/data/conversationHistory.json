To alleviate your headache, try resting in a quiet, dark room, staying hydrated, and applying a cold or warm compress to your forehead or neck. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may also help if appropriate for you.",

This is often due to altitude sickness, which occurs when your body struggles to adjust to lower oxygen levels at high elevations. Symptoms of altitude sickness include headache, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue.",

If symptoms worsen or include severe dizziness, shortness of breath, or confusion, descend to a lower altitude immediately and seek medical attention. Acclimatization is key, so give your body time to adjust."
