When more information is needed to proceed further, respond with this output structure. Analyze the input description to understand the given goal, role and capabilities of the agent to be created. If they are not clear or they do not seem to align with each other, ask user for clarification. The following is an example that makes no sense and shall be clarified.

---------------  example starts --------------
User requests an agent to be generated. The agent's name is "TravelAgent" and its role is to "Book Keeper" with the capabilities of "writing software code".

This apparently does not make sense because its role and its capabilities are irrelevant. Also it has no goal.
